## Deep Learning with Python 

* Source: **Book** 
* Recommened to: **Lower intermediate** learners

The book is written very systematically which is easy to follow. Some concepts are explained quickly like backpropagaation (I think it needs more attention). Best thing about this book is all concepts are explained with examples that reader can easily understand. 

* Chapter 1 and 2 are general information about Deep Learning (DL). The core of the book starts from Chapter 3, there are 3 real problems are given as examples:IMDB (binary classification), News Types (multiclass) and Boston Housing Price Prediction (scalar regression). These examples give clear understanding about the DL. 

* In Chapter 4, all machine learning forms are discussed briefly: supervised learning (...), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction), self supervised learning (autoencoders), reinforcement learning. All of them are just explained briefly for creating general vision and knowledge about overall ML. Following that, how to evaluate models, how to split dataset into train, validation and testing with correct way, validation types (cross validation, hold-out validation, ...), data preprocessing before giving it to model (vectorization, value normalization, handling missing values, ...) and finally how to overcome overfitting and underfitting are explained briefly (but it is enough for good start). 

**Note**: When model overfits, the model just memorizes the train samples. The reason is that model is very strong and it has many layers and nods which quite enough capacity for memorizing.
